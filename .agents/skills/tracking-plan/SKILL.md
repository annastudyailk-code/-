# Analytics Tracking Plan

## Overview

Most companies have tracking — they just don't have a plan. Events fire into
the void. Pixels fire twice (or never). Marketing attributes credit to the
wrong channel. Product doesn't know what marketing tracks. Nobody trusts the
data. The mistake: adding tracking ad-hoc without a unified plan. This skill
covers the complete analytics tracking architecture for PLG and B2B SaaS:
event taxonomy, pixel strategy, attribution architecture, CDP implementation,
and the analytics stack that makes it all work together.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: The Tracking Plan Document

**What it is:** A single source of truth for every event, property, and
destination in your analytics infrastructure. Every developer, marketer,
and analyst references the same document.

**The Tracking Plan template (Google Sheets / Notion / Avo):**

```
TRACKING PLAN — [Company]

SHEET 1: EVENT CATALOG
| Event Name | Category | Trigger | Properties | Destinations | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Signed Up | Account | POST /auth/signup | plan, source, referrer, utm_* | Segment→GA4,Amplitude,HubSpot | Eng | Live |
| Feature Used | Usage | Client-side click | feature_name, context | Segment→Amplitude | Product | Live |
| ... | | | | | | |

SHEET 2: PROPERTY CATALOG
| Property Name | Type | Example Values | Events Using | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plan | string | starter, growth, enterprise | Signed Up, Upgraded, Downgraded | Customer's subscription plan |
| source | string | google_ads, linkedin, referral | Signed Up | Acquisition channel |
| ... | | | | |

SHEET 3: DESTINATIONS
| Destination | Purpose | Events Routed | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Amplitude | Product analytics — retention, funnels, cohorts | All usage + account events | Product |
| GA4 | Web analytics — traffic, conversions, ad attribution | Page views, signups, conversions | Marketing |
| HubSpot | CRM — lead scoring, lifecycle stages | Account events, email events | RevOps |
| Intercom | Event-triggered messaging | All usage + milestone events | CS |
| Data Warehouse | BI — cross-functional reporting | All events | Data |

SHEET 4: IDENTITIES
| Identity Type | How It's Set | When | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| anonymous_id | Auto-generated (cookie/localStorage) | First visit | uuid |
| user_id | Backend generates on signup | After authentication | user_abc123 |
| group_id | Workspace/account ID | After login (B2B) | ws_xyz789 |
| email | identify() call | After signup/login | person@example.com |

SHEET 5: UTM / ATTRIBUTION
| Parameter | Required | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| utm_source | Yes | google, linkedin, newsletter | Acquisition source |
| utm_medium | Yes | cpc, organic, email, social | Channel type |
| utm_campaign | Yes | q1_launch, black_friday | Campaign name |
| utm_content | Optional | variant_a, cta_hero | Creative variant |
| utm_term | Optional | cold+email+tool | Keyword (paid search) |
| referrer | Auto | document.referrer | Referring URL |
| landing_page | Auto | window.location.pathname | First page visited |
| gclid | Auto | Google Ads auto-tagging | Google Click ID |
| fbclid | Auto | Facebook auto-tagging | Facebook Click ID |
```

### Phase 2: Event Taxonomy for PLG and SaaS

Build the event taxonomy in `references/event-taxonomy.md` when the task needs the full PLG/SaaS event library. In SKILL.md, capture only the chosen event groups, naming rules, owners, and QA gates.

### Phase 3: Pixel Strategy (1P and 3P Tagging)

**The progressive pixel architecture:**

```
TIER 1: FIRST-PARTY (Essential — always on)
  └─ CDP (Segment/Rudderstack) — server-side SDK
     No ad blockers can block server-side events.
     Critical events (signup, payment, subscription) go server-side.

TIER 2: FIRST-PARTY (Product — always on)
  └─ CDP (Segment/Rudderstack) — client-side SDK
     Behavioral events. Some ad-blocker loss (~15-30%).
     Acceptable for product analytics (you don't need 100% of
     behavioral events — you need enough to see patterns).

TIER 3: MARKETING PIXELS (Conditional — consent required)
  └─ GA4 (Google Analytics)
  └─ Google Ads Conversion Tracking
  └─ LinkedIn Insight Tag
  └─ Meta (Facebook) Pixel
  └─ Twitter/X Pixel
  └─ Reddit Pixel
  └─ Quora Pixel
  └─ Microsoft (Bing) Ads UET

TIER 4: RETARGETING (Conditional — consent required)
  └─ Google Ads Remarketing
  └─ LinkedIn Matched Audiences
  └─ Meta Custom Audiences
  └─ AdRoll / Criteo (if using)
```

**Pixel implementation hierarchy:**

```
Server-side (via CDP) — PRIMARY:
  Segment/Rudderstack → Google Ads (enhanced conversions)
  Segment/Rudderstack → Meta CAPI (Conversions API)
  Segment/Rudderstack → LinkedIn CAPI
  These are ad-blocker resistant and privacy-safe.

Client-side (via GTM) — SECONDARY:
  Google Tag Manager (GTM) loads marketing pixels
  Consent management (Cookiebot/OneTrust) gates all marketing pixels
  GTM fires only when user has consented to marketing cookies

Server-side GTM (sGTM) — ADVANCED:
  GTM server-side container proxies all pixel requests
  Your server → sGTM → marketing platforms
  First-party domain for tracking (e.g., analytics.yourdomain.com)
  This is the gold standard for privacy-safe, ad-blocker-resistant tracking
```

**Pixel audit checklist:**
```
□ Every pixel has a purpose (no "we might use this someday" pixels)
□ Consent management gates all marketing pixels
□ Pixels fire ONCE (no duplicate firing from GTM + CDP)
□ Server-side tracking for critical conversion events
□ All pixels documented: what fires when, what data it sends
□ Regular audit: remove unused pixels (they slow down the page)
□ GDPR: marketing pixels only fire with consent
□ CCPA: "Do Not Sell" respected — data sharing pixels disabled
```

### Phase 4: Attribution Architecture

**Multi-touch attribution model:**

```
FIRST-Touch: Which channel introduced them?
  → UTM params captured at first visit. Stored in cookie + user profile.

LAST-Touch: Which channel closed them?
  → UTM params at conversion. Overwrites first-touch for "last-click" view.

MULTI-Touch: Which channels touched them along the way?
  → Track every touchpoint: ad click, email click, organic visit, referral.
  → Model: linear (equal credit), time-decay (recent = more credit),
    U-shaped (first + last = most credit), W-shaped (first + MQL + SQL + close).

SELF-REPORTED: "How did you hear about us?"
  → Form field on signup/demo. Most reliable single data point.
  → Categorize responses: Search, Social, Referral, Podcast, Event, Other.
```

**Attribution data flow:**

```
TOUCHPOINT CAPTURE:
1. First visit → capture UTM + referrer → store in first-touch cookie
2. Subsequent visits → append to visit log (timestamp, source, medium)
3. Signup/Conversion → capture UTM + referrer → store in user profile
4. CRM → Sales tags opportunity source (can override self-reported)

ATTRIBUTION REPORTING:
- HubSpot/Salesforce: Original Source, Latest Source, Source Drill-Down
- GA4: Traffic Acquisition, User Acquisition reports
- BI Tool (Metabase/Looker/Mode): Custom multi-touch models
- Attribution tool (Dreamdata/HockeyStack/Attribution): B2B journey mapping
```

### Phase 5: CDP Implementation

Use `references/cdp-implementation.md` for the full Segment/RudderStack/mParticle/warehouse routing patterns. In the main response, summarize chosen destination routing, identity policy, suppression rules, and QA checks.

### Phase 6: PLG-Specific Analytics

**The PLG funnel (measure every transition):**

```
VISITOR → SIGNUP → ACTIVATION → ENGAGEMENT → CONVERSION → EXPANSION

Visitor → Signup: Signup conversion rate (target: 5-15%)
Signup → Activation: Activation rate (target: 40-60%)
Activation → Engagement: MAU/WAU/DAU ratios (target DAU/MAU > 20%)
Engagement → Conversion: Free-to-paid rate (target: 3-8%)
Conversion → Expansion: NRR (target: 110%+)
```

**Key PLG metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| PQL (Product-Qualified Lead) Rate | PQLs / Total Signups | 10-20% |
| Time to Value (TTV) | Days from signup to activation | < 7 days |
| Free-to-Paid Conversion | Paid accounts / Trial starts | 3-8% |
| DAU/MAU | Daily Active / Monthly Active | > 20% (sticky) |
| Feature Adoption Rate | Users using feature / Total users | > 30% (per core feature) |
| Viral Coefficient | Invites per user × acceptance rate | > 0.5 (viral if > 1.0) |
| Expansion MRR Rate | Expansion MRR / Starting MRR | > 3% monthly |

**PLG analytics stack:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Amplitude | Product analytics — funnels, retention, cohorts, behavioral personas |
| Mixpanel | Alternative product analytics (simpler, event-stream focused) |
| PostHog | Open-source product analytics + session recording + feature flags |
| June.so | PLG-specific analytics (auto-generated reports for B2B SaaS) |
| Pendo / Appcues | In-app guides + product analytics |
| Heap | Auto-capture analytics (no manual event tracking) |

### Phase 7: The Analytics Governance Playbook

**Tracking plan governance:**
1. **Document first, implement second.** Every event goes into the tracking
   plan BEFORE a developer writes code.
2. **Event dictionary is law.** No untracked events. No undocumented properties.
   If it's not in the dictionary, it doesn't exist.
3. **Breaking changes are forbidden.** Properties can be added. Never removed.
   Events can be deprecated (stop sending). Never deleted.
4. **Review cadence:** Monthly with product + marketing + data. Quarterly full
   audit. Remove unused events. Consolidate near-duplicates.

**Testing and validation:**
- Segment: Source Debugger (real-time event stream)
- Amplitude: Event Explorer (verify events arriving)
- GA4: DebugView (real-time event debug)
- Avo: Code-generated type-safe tracking functions
- CI/CD: Test that events fire correctly on critical paths

**Privacy and compliance:**
- No PII in event properties (name, email, IP, phone — use user_id instead)
- Consent management gates all marketing pixels
- Data retention policies documented per destination
- GDPR: ability to delete all events for a user on request
- SOC2: event tracking infrastructure within compliance scope

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Tracking plan document exists (spreadsheet or Avo) — not just code
- [ ] Event taxonomy covers Account, Usage, Activation, Engagement, Revenue, Milestones
- [ ] CDP implemented (server-side for critical events, client-side for behavioral)
- [ ] All marketing pixels consent-gated (no pre-ticked boxes)
- [ ] Server-side tracking for signup, payment, subscription changes
- [ ] UTM parameters captured and persisted to user profile
- [ ] Attribution model documented (first-touch + last-touch + multi-touch)
- [ ] PLG funnel measured at every stage transition
- [ ] Event dictionary maintained — no undocumented events
- [ ] PII audit complete — no personal data in event properties
- [ ] Monthly tracking plan review on calendar

## Quality Check

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Output matches the user's stated request
- [ ] Named frameworks or sources are reflected in the recommendation
- [ ] The deliverable is specific enough for an agent to execute
- [ ] Any assumptions, risks, or dependencies are explicit
- [ ] No unsupported claims, invented facts, or private/internal references are included

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Tracking without a plan.** Events fire into the void. No one knows what
   "button_clicked_3" means. The data is worthless. Fix: Tracking plan
   document FIRST. Implementation second. Every event has a name, purpose,
   properties, destinations, and owner.

2. **Client-side only.** Ad blockers block 15-30% of client-side tracking.
   Critical events (signup, payment, subscription) are lost. Fix: Server-side
   tracking for revenue-critical events. CDP server-side SDK.

3. **Duplicate events.** Segment fires "Signed Up." GTM also fires "SignUp."
   GA4 shows 2x signups. Nobody knows which number is real. Fix: One source
   of truth per event. Audit for duplicates. GTM ONLY handles marketing pixels,
   not core events.

4. **Marketing and product tracking disconnected.** Marketing sees signups.
   Product sees activation. Nobody connects the two — can't answer "which
   marketing channel produces the most activated users?" Fix: Same event
   taxonomy. Same user_id. CDP routes to both marketing and product tools.

5. **No attribution on signup.** UTM params captured on visit but lost on
   signup. "Where did this customer come from?" = shrug. Fix: Capture UTM
   params on first visit. Persist to user profile on signup. Always.

6. **PII in event properties.** `email: "person@example.com"` tracked in every
   event. This is a privacy violation and a security risk. Fix: Use user_id.
   Store PII in your database, not your event pipeline. Only `identify()` call
   carries user traits — regular `track()` calls do not.

## Execution Artifacts

- `references/framework-notes.md` — named frameworks, citation anchors, and operating assumptions
- `references/cdp-implementation.md` — CDP implementation patterns
- `references/event-taxonomy.md` — Event naming and governance reference
- `templates/output-template.md` — copy-paste deliverable structure for the user
- `scripts/check-output.py` — local checklist validator for required sections
This skill includes lightweight artifacts the agent can load on demand:
Use the artifacts when the user asks for an implementation-ready deliverable, a repeatable workflow, or a quality check rather than generic advice.
